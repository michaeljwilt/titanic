## Thanks for checking out my project!

In this *machine learning model* we take will attempt to find our best variables to predict sruvival rate for passengers of the Titanic.

Which could be a better predictor of seasons long tv shows? Let's find out!

For exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing purposes we performed the following:

Wrangled, cleaned and recoded data
Implemented Decision Tree and Random Forest models
Performed Hyperparameter tuning on our Random Forest model
Utilized Feature Importance to determine best predictors of survival

Conclusions:

With a 72% accuracy we were able to predict survival rate for the passengers
Our most important variables to predict survival are:
  1. Sex - plays the biggest role
  2. Fare
  3. Age
  4. Deck

By taking a look at these 4 variables, we can determine with decent accuracy whether one would've survived on the titanic.
